# AWS S3-Bucket SVG Optimizer

That's a mouthful. But that's what it does. Connect it to your bucket and it optimizes all the svgs in it. (via https://github.com/svg/svgo)

```bash
# Usage:
    # Either use .env file or write AWS_BUCKET=myBucket AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_id>
    node index.js
    # Enjoy!
```

Don't hesitate to tweak it or report bugs! More options will come later, as well as a `npm` package!
